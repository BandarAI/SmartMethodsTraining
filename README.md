# Smart Methods Training 2023
Smart Methods summer training presents an exceptional opportunity to gain comprehensive knowledge in designing robots from A to Z. This program covers all aspects of robot design, including mechanical and electrical engineering, web development, Robot Operating System (ROS), natural language processing (NLP), and other essential topics.

The training program is meticulously crafted to provide students with a well-rounded understanding of the entire robot design process. Participants will delve into mechanical and electrical design principles by learning how to create physical parts of the robots and utilize mechanical components like Arduino and motors, learning about web development techniques encompassing HTML, CSS, Javascript and connecting them to a database using XAMPP. Additionally, participants will gain proficiency in Robot Operating System (ROS) and various other essential topics.

# Training Paths
There are six paths. Each trainee is required to select one of these paths and complete four tasks. Knowing that trainees have the freedom to do tasks from other paths. 
The paths are as follows:

1. [Mechanical Engineering](https://github.com/BandarAI/SmartMethodsTraining/tree/Tasks/Mechanical%20Engineering)
2. [Electrical and Power Engineering](https://github.com/BandarAI/SmartMethodsTraining/tree/Tasks/Electrical%20and%20Power%20Engineering)
3. [Artificial Intelligence & Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://github.com/BandarAI/SmartMethodsTraining/tree/Tasks/AI%20%26%20ROS)
4. [Web Development & Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/BandarAI/SmartMethodsTraining/tree/Tasks/Web%20development%20%26%20NLP)
5. [Internet of Things](https://github.com/BandarAI/SmartMethodsTraining/tree/Tasks/IoT)
6. [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://github.com/BandarAI/SmartMethodsTraining/tree/Tasks/Industrial%20and%20Systems%20Engineering)

# Benefits of the Training Program
There are numerous advantages of the training program, I will specifically mention the certifications attainable through it.

1. 4 tasks from your primary path + 2 tasks from other 4 paths = 12 tasks = Full Stack Robotics Engineer certification
2. Certification from Technical and Vocational Training Corporation

The certifications are authorized by [MECAI](https://www.mecai.org/) and Technical and Vocational Training Corporation
