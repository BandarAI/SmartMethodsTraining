# Task Brief
The task goal is to design an embedded systems processor (ESP) with LED lights. Each LED light represents a specific direction which will be linked to a database.
The system will take inpout of the direction of the robot and then turn on the LED light.

# Task Execution Details
For this task I have used wokwi ismulator with five LED lights each LED light represent a color
* Blue for forward
* Green for backward
* Orange for right
* Yellow for left
* Purple for stop

The implementation was supposed to get the direction value from the database. I have faced a difficulty in linking the wokwi simulator with my database so I have used the same directions links that were provided during the task lecture.
