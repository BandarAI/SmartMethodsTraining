# Task Brief
The goal of this task is to design a speech-to-text page and store it into the database.

# Task Execution Details
To implement speech recognition to text on the browser, I used web speech API by JavaScript and used PHP language to insert the text into the database.
Is is important to note that implmentation only works for the Chrome browser. The interface has no start button, Instead, users simply need to speak into the microphone and the recording will start automatically.
