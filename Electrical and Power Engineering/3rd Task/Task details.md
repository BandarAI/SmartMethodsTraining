# Task Brief
The task goal is to design and implement a distance sensor circuit and a digital sensor

# Task Execution Details

## Distance Sensor Circuit Design
To create the distance sensor, I used ultrasnoic distance sensor with LED light. When there is an object within the sensor's range, the LED light will illuminate.

## Digital Sensor Design
The goal of this task was not clear to me. I used an image from the lecture to design the digital sensor.

The digital sensor has a pulsating LED light, which is generating an on/off signal. Used oscilloscope to visually represented the signals produced by the LED light. Note that it does not require coding
